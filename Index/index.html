        <h3>Password Security & Securing Passwords</h3>

        <p>Password security is often overlooked, passwords tend to end up 
            being something related to your personal life. Like a pets name 
            followed by your birth year. This makes them easy to remember, 
            but easier for intruders compromise. Creating randomly generated 
            passwords that include uppercase, lowercase, numerical and special 
            characters is an easy way to increase security and the longer the 
            better. But this makes remembering them close to impossible. This 
            is where securing your passwords with an AES-256 encrypted password 
            manager comes in. Password managers are a great way to store multiple 
            passwords. While only having to remember a single password. Think of 
            it as a cyber safe!

        <h3>
            Enabling Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
        </h3>

        <p>
            Multi-factor Authentication or MFA, is an additional shield for your 
            account. When MFA is enabled, you require two or more types of virtual 
            evidence. This normally comes in the form a code. The code can be 
            accessed through a authentication application or sent directly to 
            the mobile number associated to the account. It can be thought as an 
            additional shield(s) to your account. You can set up more than one 
            authentication type.

        <h3>
            Use Encryption For Sensitive Data
        </h3>

        <p>
            Encryption is like a blender for your data. Your data goes in and the 
            shredded data comes out. The data is not lost, it just comes out in a 
            new form. To return the data back to its original form, you need a 
            special key. In the case of our blended data, it requires a special 
            glue to piece back together correctly. Without that glue the data is 
            unreadable.  Only one bottle of this special glue exists. AES-256 
            Encryption, currently the most secure form of encryption widely available. 
            If you truly value your sensitive data, make sure you are using websites 
            and applications that use AES-256 encryption for your sensitive data. 
            To this day, it has not been broken. But always keep up-to-date with 
            newer more secure methods.

        <h3>
            Keep Your Applications & Systems Up-To-Date
        </h3>

        <p>
            This is one of the easiest ways to reduce the potential of threats and 
            attacks against your information. Keep your applications and systems 
            updated. You will be protected against exploits that have been exposed. 
            For example, if you use Windows 11.  You should regularly check and 
            install security related updates. If you use Apple products, make sure 
            you are using the most recent iOS version. Having out of date software 
            can increase the exposure of your data. Most systems allow you to set 
            updates to be automatic, even while you sleep. Do not neglect this feature!
        </p>

        <h3>
            Use Your Own Devices & Private Networks
        </h3>

        <p>
            Never! Access your accounts on shared devices or public networks. Even 
            if your are using a friends device. You can never be sure what they have 
            or have not done to expose their device(s) to potential threats and exploits. 
            Public networks often have extremely weak security in place to allow easy 
            access when connecting your devices. If you are just browsing news articles, 
            go for it. But to avoid any exposure of sensitive data, do not access your 
            financial accounts on public networks!
