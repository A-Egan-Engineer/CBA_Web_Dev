        <h3>Password Security & Securing Passwords</h3>

        <p>Password securtiy is often overlooked, they tend to end up being something related to your personal life, like a pets name 
            followed by your birth year. This makes them easy to remember, but easier for intruders compromise. Creating randomly generated 
            passwords that include uppercase, lowercase, numerical and special characters is an easy way to increase securtiy and the longer the better. 
            But this makes remembering them near impossible. This is where securing your paswords with an encrypted password manager comes in. 
            Password Managers are a great way to store multitple passwords, while only having to remember a single password.
